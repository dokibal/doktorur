                        <p className='aboutdetails'>
                        Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm BalÃ¡zs Doktor, a mechanical engineer turned software developer. 
                        I began my software journey during my university years and started my career as a frontend developer intern at L&M Solutions Kft. 
                        My role allowed me to hone my skills in crafting user-friendly interfaces and creating seamless user experiences.
                        </p>
                        <p className='aboutdetails'>
                        However, my thirst for knowledge led me to bridge the gap between engineering and software development even further. 
                        I transitioned to Robert Bosch Kft., where I took on the role of a C++ developer. During my time there  
                        I specialized in hardware-centric C++ software development, primarily focusing on developing control software for cameras.
                        </p>
                        <p className='aboutdetails'>
                        More recently, I've ventured into the realm of Java and Spring Boot, further diversifying my skill set. 
                        This shift reflects my growing interest in backend development, as I explore the intricacies of building robust server-side applications.
                        </p>
                        <p className='aboutdetails'>
                        I thrive on tackling challenges and consistently strive for excellence in everything I do. 
                        Working in an international environment comes naturally to me, and I'm adept at transparently communicating my thoughts and ideas to others.
                        </p>
                        <p className='aboutdetails'>
                        In my free time, I'm an avid sports enthusiast, whether it's playing soccer with friends or going for a run. 
                        When the opportunity arises, I love to explore new places through travel, broadening my horizons and creating lasting memories.
                        </p>
